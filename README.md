# Out of the Brew ☕️ - CSS Final Project
## Description

This is the final source code for the final CSS/Bootstrap project that was created for the purpose of the Website Design course, with professor [Gregory Prokopski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopski/) 🔗.

In this course we learned about CSS and how to incorporate frameworks, such as Bootstrap to design website pages, according to W3C specifications. The focus was on understanding
Selectors, Inline Layout, Floating and Positioning. The course also covered how to build effective navigation, how to layout pages, and how to work with typography, colours, backgrounds, and white space. As browsers do not always behave like the specifications recommend, we opted for a real-world approach, concentrating on browser inconsistencies and hands-on final project that summarized the topics covered in class.
